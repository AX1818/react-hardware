title: "Bringing React to the Physical World"

React Hardware embraces React Native’s “Learn Once, Write Anywhere” motto and
enables you to apply your React component model to hardware and physical
devices.

## Motivation

The original article regarding React Hardware can be seen at [http://iamdustan.com/2015/12/16/react-hardware/](http://iamdustan.com/2015/12/16/react-hardware/).

Hardware can already be powered by JavaScript, although none provide such a
declarative or composable abstraction as React. Seeing how revolutionary React
and the ecosystem around it has been for user interface engineering, it seems
likely that these same models could be applied to physical devices. React
Hardware aims to enable another generation of JavaScript developers an easy
platform for controlling hardware as well as open up a new platform for
experimentation and tooling.

Some experiments to look forward to are:

* Flux and Redux with hardware (including Redux DevTools)
* React DevTools for in-browser viewing and editing of your hardware tree
* Live reloading (of simple data points)
* Render hardware models (such as [frizting](http://fritzing.org/))) and control
  your device from the same codebase. (Universal JavaScript 3.0)
