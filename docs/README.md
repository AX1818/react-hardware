# React Hardware Documentation

These docs are built with [GatsbyJS](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby).

To run:

* `npm install -g gatsby`
* `gatsby develop`

## Caveat

Currently Gatsby is using Babel 5, which has conflicts with Babel 6 as used by
React Hardware. You will need to temporarily remove the root directory .babelrc
file for `gatsby` to run.
